20th century attempt to use literal missiles to deliver physical cargo and letters. Idea popped up in the 1930s (Friedrich Schmiedl and Gerhard Zucker) and got serious attention in the 50s and 60s when rocket tech was shiny and new.

Inventors and postal authorities imagined bypassing slow ground routes entirely—fire a rocket full of mail from one place to another, land it (hopefully intact), and you’d have near-instant delivery over long distances.

In practice, it was mostly a publicity stunt. Rockets were expensive, imprecise, and occasionally exploded, turning your heartfelt letter into flaming confetti. The U.S. even ran a 1959 Navy test (Rear Admiral William F.), firing a Regulus cruise missile loaded with mail between Virginia and Florida, but it was more about showing off Cold War tech than building a real postal service.

The concept fizzled because, shockingly, the regular post office was cheaper and less prone to catastrophic fiery failure.
