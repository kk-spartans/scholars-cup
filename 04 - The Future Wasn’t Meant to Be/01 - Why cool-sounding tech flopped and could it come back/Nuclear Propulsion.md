could-come-back: Already used in submarines

Instead of burning fuel to hurl mass out the back of your object using chemical reactions, you use nuclear reactors.

Used in submarines, icebreakers, and some aircraft carriers - submarines being the most notable.

Submarines to constantly surface to gather oxygen to make their diesel generators produce electricity so they can sink down again. If you use nuclear reactors to produce energy instead, you’ll have to surface *much* less often (still have to because of the crew’s sanity).
