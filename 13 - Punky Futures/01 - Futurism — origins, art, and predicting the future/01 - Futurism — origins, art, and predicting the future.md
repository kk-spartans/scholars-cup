> The future began in 1909—or, at least, futurism did. When Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti [coined the word 'futurism'](https://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/foundingmanifesto/), he imagined a world of speed, danger, and beauty. To him, this future could be found in the swift efficiency of the automobile. Today’s futurists look further ahead to artificial intelligence, space travel, and the blending of human and machine. Explore the origin and development of futurism, then discuss with your team: how is it different from science fiction—or is it? Should we value works that predicted futures that never came to be?

Futurism started in 1909 with Marinetti’s *Futurist Manifesto*; it mostly consisted of speed, technology, youth, and rejection of the past. Cars, trains, and industrialization were seen as beautiful. It later spread to painting, sculpture, literature, and music.

Futurism is artistic, and philosophical. It imagines how the future feels like now, and celebrated tech. Sci-fi is narrative, and speculative. It asks “what if” and explores the future with stories.

There is sometimes an overlap, both speculate the future — but one with a manifesto with paint, the other with a story (with words).

We should definitely value these. Even if we don’t end up with a world of supersonic cars. These challenge norms, and maybe even inspire someone to make that the future.
