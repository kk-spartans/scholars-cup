> The [atompunk movement](https://www.aesdes.org/2024/01/24/atompunk/) imagines what the world would have been like if the “Atomic Age” after World War II had continued to flourish on to the present day. Explore works in this style, including the Fallout video game and TV series along with those below, then discuss with your team: would you want to live in an atompunk vision of the present?

## Fallout In A Nutshell

Humans build nukes, the world blows itself up, and the few survivors hide in vaults. Decades later, you crawl out, find mutants, raiders, and crazy tech, and pick sides between warring factions, trying to survive while deciding the fate of the wasteland. Basically, post-apocalyptic road trip with guns and moral choices.

I would **not** have liked to live in an atompunk vision of this world — the less atomic bombs and chernobyl reactor failures, the better. WW2 was torture, for everyone in this world.
