Kabiru turns e-waste into wearable futurisms: the “spectacles” are literal tech relics repurposed into Afrofuturist ornaments. That practice—making futures from discarded modernity—is a material example of Afrofuturist aesthetics: resourceful, local, and defiantly speculative. The Met frames Kabiru’s work in Afrofuturist curatorial projects.
