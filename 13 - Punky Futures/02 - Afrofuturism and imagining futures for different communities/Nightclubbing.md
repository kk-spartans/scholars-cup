Jones turned persona into speculative design: androgyny, bricolage fashion, and a voice that collapsed disco, reggae, and new wave. Her look and performance style function like mini speculative worlds — a body rewriting gender, race, and celebrity norms — which scholars link to Afrofuturist aesthetics (performative futurity, techno-glamour). She’s less about spaceships and more about reimagining the human.
