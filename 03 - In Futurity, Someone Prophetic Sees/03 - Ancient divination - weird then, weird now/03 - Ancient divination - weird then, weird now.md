> Anthropologists believe that this sort of divination is a practice as old as Neolithic humans. Look briefly (no rabbit holes, please) into the following ancient divination techniques, then discuss with your team: which are still practiced today, and, if they seem hard to believe now, why do you think so many people once believed in them?

```dataview

I feel like most of the ones which were discontinued included killing animals, judging people based on their looks, or just felt kiddish (looking at water, chickens pecking, etc) — all of which our current society doesn’t accept.

Another reason is looking at water move isn’t as fun as predicting the future based on the position of stars in the sky.
