```
The Future—never spoke—  
Nor will He—like the Dumb—  
Reveal by sign—a syllable  
Of His Profound To Come—  
```

The future won’t even hint at what’s coming, it’ll act dumb.

```
But when the News be ripe—  
Presents it—in the Act—  
Forestalling Preparation—  
Escape—or Substitute—  
```

Once it’s time for the future to happen, it just happens — no prep time.

```
  
Indifference to Him—  
The Dower—as the Doom—  
His Office—but to execute  
Fate’s—Telegram—to Him—
```

The future doesn’t care about you, the indifference is both the gift (dower) and the punishment (doom).
