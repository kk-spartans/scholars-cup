```
Some say the world will end in fire,  
Some say in ice.  
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire  
I hold with those who favor fire. 
```

He thinks the world will end in fire and agrees with the ones who think the same.

```
But if it had to perish twice,  
I think I know enough of hate  
To say that for destruction ice  
Is also great  
And would suffice.
```

If the world came back to life, burning down in ice would be better for him.
