```
Leucon, no one’s allowed to know his fate,  
```

`Leucon` is the person who this is being sent to, `Leuconoe` was in the actual poem, but this is a modern translation.

And `his` isn’t referring to anyone in particular, basically means “their” or “anyone’s”

```
Not you, not me: don’t ask, don’t hunt for answers  

In tea leaves or palms. Be patient with whatever comes.  
```

This is a reference to old ways of fortune telling.

 - Tea leaves is “tasseography”, an old form of fortune telling by reading patterns in tea residue.
 - Palms is just “palmistry”, reading someone’s fate by the lines on their hands.

```
This could be our last winter, it could be many  

More, pounding the Tuscan Sea on these rocks:  
```

The Tuscan sea is the Tyrrhenian Sea, west of Italy. Just a poetic way to name it, since it borders Tuscanny.

```

Do what you must, be wise, cut your vines  

And forget about hope. Time goes running, even  

As we talk. Take the present, the future’s no one’s affair.
```

Cut your vines basically just means “stop dreaming, start doing”.
