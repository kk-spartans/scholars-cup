> Some poets have also taken a swing at predicting the future. Consider the selections below, then discuss with your team: how seriously were they intended to tell the future? Is poetry (with its often murky meanings) the perfect vehicle for prophecy?

> - William Butler Yeats | “[The Second Coming](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming)” (1919)
> - Robert Frost | “[Fire and Ice](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44263/fire-and-ice)” (1920)
> - Emily Dickinson | “[The Future—never spoke](https://hellopoetry.com/poem/2692/the-futurenever-spoke/)” (1921)

Look at my analysis on these poems (took a lot of digging):

```dataview
table
from "03 - In Futurity, Someone Prophetic Sees/02 - Can poetry really predict anything"
where file.name != "02 - Can poetry really predict anything"
```

They were very seriously intended to predict the future in my opinion, based on the words used — it doesn’t seem like that was just to rhyme.

And I feel like poetry is a good way to express opinion, not prophecy. Prophecy is deterministic.
