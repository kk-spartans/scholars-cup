> Some poets have also taken a swing at predicting the future. Consider the selections below, then discuss with your team: how seriously were they intended to tell the future? Is poetry (with its often murky meanings) the perfect vehicle for prophecy?

```dataview
table author, year, link
from "03 - In Futurity, Someone Prophetic Sees/02 - Can poetry really predict anything"
where file.name != "02 - Can poetry really predict anything"
```

They were very seriously intended to predict the future in my opinion (based on the words used) — it doesn’t seem like that was just to rhyme.

And I feel like poetry is a good way to express opinion, not prophecy. Prophecy is deterministic.
