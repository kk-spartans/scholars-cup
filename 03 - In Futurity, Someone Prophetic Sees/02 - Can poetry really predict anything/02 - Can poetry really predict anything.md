## Ode I. 11

```
Leucon, no one’s allowed to know his fate,  

Not you, not me: don’t ask, don’t hunt for answers  

In tea leaves or palms. Be patient with whatever comes.  

This could be our last winter, it could be many  

More, pounding the Tuscan Sea on these rocks:  

Do what you must, be wise, cut your vines  

And forget about hope. Time goes running, even  

As we talk. Take the present, the future’s no one’s affair.
```

This is genuinely kinda harsh, but based on my research — `Luecon` is supposed to just mean “Dear reader” or something in the Stone Age.
