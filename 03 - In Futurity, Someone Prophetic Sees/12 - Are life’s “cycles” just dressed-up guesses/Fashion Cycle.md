The cycle of fashion trends; 
 - They start out expensive (introduction) so mostly celebrities buy them (rise).
 - The celebs wearing them attracts the attention of the general public (peak).
 - Manufacturers produce it so much people get bored of it, so it declines in popularity (decline).
 - Itâ€™s obsolete and the next trend happens (obsolescence).
