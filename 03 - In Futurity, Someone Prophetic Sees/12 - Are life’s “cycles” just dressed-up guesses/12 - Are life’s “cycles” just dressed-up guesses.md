> “Ripped jeans will be back in fashion in 20 years”, says one pundit. “We’ve been in a decade-long bull market, but just you wait for the bear market”, says another. Research the following popular “cycles” in public discourse today and explore with your team: what do they purport to predict, and how accurate are their predictions? Can a popular “cycle” ever become a scientific model?

 ```dataview
list
from "03 - In Futurity, Someone Prophetic Sees/12 - Are life’s “cycles” just dressed-up guesses"
where file.name != "12 - Are life’s “cycles” just dressed-up guesses"
```

These cycles can definitely be a scientific model, they’re probably more accurate than AI — and we use AI for some scientific models.
