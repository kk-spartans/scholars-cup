> Not all methods of foretelling the future are rooted in superstition or ritual; some stem from long-term observations and lived experiences. For example, the [Chinese agricultural calendar](https://www.scmp.com/yp/discover/lifestyle/article/3205168/chinese-agricultural-calendar-ancient-people-combined-lunar-and-solar-years-know-when-plant-harvest) is based on centuries observing the weather and the movement of celestial bodies. The result is a calendar that [reliably predicts](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/12/1198909292/lunar-new-year-chinese-lunisolar-calendar-history) the movements of the sun and moon, ocean tides, astronomical events, and the turning of the seasonsâ€”one still referenced by farmers today.
