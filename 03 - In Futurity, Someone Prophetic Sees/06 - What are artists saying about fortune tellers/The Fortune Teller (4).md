The woman seems sad by looking at the prediction that the fortune teller gave her. I think the artist is trying to tell us that by predicting the future, we’ll just feel sad.

And in the background, when you zoom in — it looks like a man is running away from someone. Maybe the man’s a thief? The artist wouldn’t have intentionally chosen to draw that without a reason, this isn’t just decoration.

And I think the thief is a fortune teller.
