I think the thing in the back is an owl, and owls signify wisdom. If whoever is in the foreground is Rasputin, then it looks the owl is trying to give the Rasputin advice.

But Rasputin isn’t listening, he’s busy being sad about his own problems and grieving about the past instead of enjoying the present.

So, like the other paintings, the artist is trying to tell us to focus on the present and not the past.
