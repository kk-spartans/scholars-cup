Went to a fortune teller  
Had my fortune read  
I didn't know what to tell her  
I had a dizzy feeling in my head  

Then she took a look at my palm  
She said, "Sonny, you feel kinda warm"  
She looked into her crystal ball  
And said, "You're in love"  

I said how could that be so  
I'm not tight with none of the girls I know  
She said, "When the next one arrives  
You'll be lookin' into her eyes"  

I left there in a hurry  
A-lookin' forward to my big surprise  
The next day I discovered  
That the fortune teller told me a lie  

I hurried back down to that woman  
Mad as I could be  
I told her I didn't see nobody  
Why she made a fool of me

Then something struck me  
As if it came from up above  
While lookin' at the fortune teller  
I fell in love  

Now, I'm a happy fellow  
I'm married to the fortune teller  
We're happy as we can be  
(And now I get my fortune told for free)

## What I Think he’s Trying To Tell Us

Maybe the future is right in front of us. Maybe we’re overcomplicating this and we just need to look straight. That’s it.
