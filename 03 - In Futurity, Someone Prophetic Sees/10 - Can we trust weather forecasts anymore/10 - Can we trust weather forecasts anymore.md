> Your weather app predicts a warm and dry afternoon; you wear a summer dress and you wind up drenched by an unexpected afternoon rainstorm. Research how meteorologists make weather forecasts and explore with your team: [how far ahead in time](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/11/07/science-says-specific-weather-forecasts-cant-be-made-more-than-ten-days-advance/) is a weather forecast useful? How might [AI prediction models](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/dec/04/google-deepmind-predicts-weather-more-accurately-than-leading-system) change the field of meteorology? Be sure to also learn the difference between [weather and climate models](https://theconversation.com/whats-the-difference-between-climate-and-weather-models-it-all-comes-down-to-chaos-244914), and if they are still accurate in face of a changing climate.

## How far ahead in time is a weather forecast useful?

How far ahead in time is it *useful*? For me (a person who barely goes outside, and doesn’t care about what happens outside even if I do), they aren’t useful. For a regular person, a few hours, just to make sure they don’t get drenched.

How far ahead in time can they be made accurately? 8-12 days. The articles say it.

## AI prediction models

These models are insanely fast (I can’t say anything about the accuracy). I ran GraphCast on my own, with some old ERA5 data - and it finished predicting 10 days in advance, with 6 hour intervals for 0.25 degree accuracy (about 25km<sup>2</sup>)
