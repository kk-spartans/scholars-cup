> Did you freely choose to read this bullet, or were you always bound to find yourself puzzling over it at this very moment? Explore the age-old debate between those who believe we have free will and those who believe we live in a deterministic universe, then discuss with your team: how much does it matter whether we are making choices for ourselves? Is it possible that some people have more free will than others? And, if criminals are not really choosing to be criminals, should they still be punished? Be sure to learn the differences between genetic, biological, and other forms of determinism.

I feel like we completely don’t have free will — at all. I don’t think we’re a simulation, just we don’t have free will.

The reason I don’t think we are a simulation is that that would require infinite compute power, because the computer you build would have to simulate itself. The universe doesn’t have infinite power.

## How much does it matter whether we’re making choices for ourselves?

^8e03c5

Imo, not much. 

If you now know that whatever you do doesn’t matter, are you going to commit s\*icide? Are you going to drop out school or quit your job? No.

You’ll ignore it, because that’s normal. Humans don’t like doing things that aren’t normal.

## Is it possible that some people have more free will than others?

In someone else’s opinion, yes. But according to me, no — no one has free will, according to me (very untrustworthy source).

## If criminals aren’t really choosing to be criminals, should they still be punished?

Yes, because that’s the law. [[08 - Do we really have free will#^8e03c5|As discussed before]], humans don’t like change — and just because we don’t have free will doesn’t mean we have to change our lifestyle.
