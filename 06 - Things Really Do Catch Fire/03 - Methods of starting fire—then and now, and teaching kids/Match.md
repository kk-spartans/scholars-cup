A stick made of wood (or sometimes cardboard), with a head and a striking surface as a peripheral in safety matches.

## Types of matches

 - **Safety matches** - Only ignite on a special surface
 - **Strike-anywhere matches** - Ignites on any rough surface because the head contains reactive phosphorus
 - **Waterproof matches** - Coated to resist water, use stronger chemicals to keep burning even in soaked places
 - **Lifeboat matches** - Designed to burn underwater, coated with magnesium
