When something catches fire, mostly because of these:

## Thermal Ignition

Heat alone causes the reaction. Paper or wood igniting when exposed to a flame or hot surface.

## Self-Ignition (Spontaneous Combustion)

Material ignites without an external flame or spark. Oily rags oxidizing and catching fire on their own.

## Electric Ignition

Electricity triggers ignition. Electric matches in pyrotechnics.
