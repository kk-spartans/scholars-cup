Basically the [[Fire Triangle]] but with “chemical chain reaction” added.

You might ask: “How do you remove the chemical chain reaction in a fire without removing anything else?”.

Well that’s *exactly* how [halons](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Halon&oldid=1270044172) work.

Normally, a fire would look something like this: 

> H• + O<sub>2</sub> → OH• + O• → more reactions → fire continues

(• means the substance is a radical, it has an unpaired electron. Radicals are **insanely** reactive because that lonely electron _really_ wants a buddy, so it’ll grab the first thing it can—often violently.)

But with a halon present:

> H• + Br<sub>2</sub> → HBr + Br•  
> OH• + HBr → H<sub>2</sub>O + Br•
