How does it burn? Depends on the material, but some common ones are:

## Most hydrocarbons

> Fuel (C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>) + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + heat/light

For example, methane:

> CH<sub>4</sub>​ + 2O<sub>2</sub> ​→ CO<sub>2</sub> ​+ 2H<sub>2</sub>​O + energy

## Most metals

For example, magnesium:

> 2Mg + O<sub>2</sub> → 2MgO

## Phosphorus

> 4P + 5O<sub>2</sub>​ → 2P<sub>2</sub>​O<sub>5</sub>​

## Hydrogen

> 2H<sub>2</sub>​ + O<sub>2</sub> ​→ 2H<sub>2</sub>​O

## Sulfur

Blue flame, smells awful.
