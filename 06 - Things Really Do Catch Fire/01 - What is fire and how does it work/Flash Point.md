Really hard to understand; it’s the lowest temperature at which a liquid gives off enough vapor to ignite in the air if there’s a flame, spark or another ignition source nearby.

Fire point is basically flash point but it keeps burning even when you take the ignition source away (usually 10C - 40C depending on the liquid).

 - **At flash point** - will ignite, might not continue to
 - **At fire point** - will stay on fire until one of the
