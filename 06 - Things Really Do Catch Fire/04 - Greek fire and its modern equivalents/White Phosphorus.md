Also called tetraphosphorus (P<sub>4</sub>), burns on contact with air. Samples are commonly coated with white "diphosphorus pentoxide", which consists of P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub> tetrahedra with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at their vertices. ([wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=White_phosphorus&oldid=1305393266))

Stored underwater or in an inert gas because oxygen ignites it immediately. Causes severe burns and organ damage if you touch it.
