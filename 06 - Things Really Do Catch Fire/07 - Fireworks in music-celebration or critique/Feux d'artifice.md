This is *fire*.

The bass, the high pitched parts, everything — and looking at the musician play the piano is even more autonomous sensory meridian response inducing.

Although I feel like this song is more trying to criticize fireworks compared to the other ones, especially with the higher pitched parts — it feels like someone’s getting hurt or the type of music they play in those sad scenes in movies.
