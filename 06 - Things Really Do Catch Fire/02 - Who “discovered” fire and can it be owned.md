> Next, explore the history of fire. Was it discovered or invented, and by whom and when? How often is this history [revised](https://www.history.com/news/human-ancestors-tamed-fire-earlier-than-thought)? ([alternate link](https://archive.is/a8cjb)) Discuss with your team: if someone had first come up with fire in 2024, would they have been able to patent or copyright it? (And would it have been subject to international copyright laws?) Did anyone “own” fire in a similar way in the ancient world?

Maybe I’m just going insane — but if you ignore the fact that we couldn’t have developed enough to even come up with the idea of patents and copyrights, it’s still not going to get accepted.
