> Next, explore the history of fire. Was it discovered or invented, and by whom and when? How often is this history [revised](https://www.history.com/news/human-ancestors-tamed-fire-earlier-than-thought)? ([alternate link](https://archive.is/a8cjb)) Discuss with your team: if someone had first come up with fire in 2024, would they have been able to patent or copyright it? (And would it have been subject to international copyright laws?) Did anyone “own” fire in a similar way in the ancient world?

Maybe I’m just going insane — but if you ignore the fact that we couldn’t have developed enough to even come up with the idea of patents and copyrights, it’s still not going to get accepted.

## Patents

But that doesn’t mean it’s against law, I read through

And **nowhere** does it say you can’t patent natural phenomena. I could patent gravity if I wanted to according to the US constitution, and I can patent fire because it contains matter or something...?

## Oh God, But The ***US Supreme Court* DEFINITELY CARES**.

(find the court opinion of this from *somewhere* [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/24), I don’t have that much free time)

In lot’s of places, the Supreme Court claimed you can’t patent natural phenomena.

## Copyright

And you can’t copyright fire, it’s a fact, and idea, a process, a system, and a method of operation at the same time — everything that can’t be copyrighted. Copyright is for creative work, not scientific discovery
