> Next, explore the history of fire. Was it discovered or invented, and by whom and when? How often is this history [revised](https://www.history.com/news/human-ancestors-tamed-fire-earlier-than-thought)? ([alternate link](https://archive.is/a8cjb)) Discuss with your team: if someone had first come up with fire in 2024, would they have been able to patent or copyright it? (And would it have been subject to international copyright laws?) Did anyone “own” fire in a similar way in the ancient world?

Maybe I’m just going insane — but if you ignore the fact that we couldn’t have developed enough to even come up with the idea of patents and copyrights, it’s still not going to get accepted.

## Patents

But that doesn’t mean it’s against law, I read through

 - and [this](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title35/html/USCODE-2011-title35-partII-chap10-sec103.htm)

And **nowhere** does it say you can’t patent natural phenomena. I could patent gravity if I wanted to according to the US constitution, and I can patent fire because it contains matter or something...?

## Oh God, But The ***US Supreme Court* DEFINITELY CARES**.

(find the court opinion of this from *somewhere* [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/24), I don’t have that much free time)

In lot’s of places, the Supreme Court claimed you can’t patent natural phenomena.

 - “[For patents cannot issue for the discovery of the phenomena of nature](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/333/127#p4)”
 - “[A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented,](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep055/usrep055156/usrep055156.pdf#page=**20**)” <!--Did you know you could do that to pdf urls?-->
 - “[The laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas have been held not patentable](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep447/usrep447303/usrep447303.pdf#page=7)”
 - and more, which I don’t wanna find


## Copyright

And you can’t copyright fire, it’s a fact, and idea, a process, a system, and a method of operation at the same time — everything that can’t be copyrighted. Copyright is for creative work, not scientific discovery.

## Ancient World

Then, examine fire’s role in human evolution and culture. How did controlling fire change diet, social structures, and migration patterns? Consider technological developments: from simple sparks to flint tools, to controlled hearths, to modern combustion engines. Compare these innovations—how do incremental improvements differ legally and philosophically from “discovering” fire itself? Debate: if a modern scientist created a new type of flame with unique properties, would that be patentable, or is it still considered a natural phenomenon? (Reference relevant patent law.) Finally, reflect on symbolism: fire as a metaphor for knowledge, destruction, and creativity—does that “ownership” ever translate into law or society?
