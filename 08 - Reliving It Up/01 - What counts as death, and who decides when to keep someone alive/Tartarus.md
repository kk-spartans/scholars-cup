The deepest abyss of the underworld, even below Hades’ realm. Only for criminals, oath-breakers, and enemies of the gods. Titans got locked up there after losing to Zeus.

Filled with eternal punishment — rolling boulders up hills, thirst with water just out of reach, birds eating your liver daily.
