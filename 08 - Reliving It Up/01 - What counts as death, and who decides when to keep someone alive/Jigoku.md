Japanese concept of hell, heavily influenced by Buddhism but colored by Japanese folklore. Ran by Enma (borrowed from Yama), with oni (demons) carrying out punishments.

Sinners are tortured in specific ways depending on their crimes â€” boiling, flaying, crushing, etc. Eventually, souls can work their way out via purification or karmic rebalance.
