> Noah might not have needed an ark if he’d had the Arctic. Stashed away above the Arctic circle, the Svalbard [Global Seed Vault](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/05/opinion/svalbard-seed-vault-climate-change/) is dedicated to preserving seeds from around the world to guard against extinction. Research it and [similar efforts](https://www.foodandwine.com/news/oreo-doomsday-vault-norway), then discuss with your team: how important is the preservation of living samples of today’s species for future generations?

The [Global Seed Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault&oldid=1303802826) is also something to mention here, it’s very useful.

That’s also right next to the [Github Arctic Code Vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o), which has very notable repos like:
