> Noah might not have needed an ark if he’d had the Arctic. Stashed away above the Arctic circle, the Svalbard [Global Seed Vault](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/05/opinion/svalbard-seed-vault-climate-change/) is dedicated to preserving seeds from around the world to guard against extinction. Research it and [similar efforts](https://www.foodandwine.com/news/oreo-doomsday-vault-norway), then discuss with your team: how important is the preservation of living samples of today’s species for future generations?

The [doomsday vault](https://seedvault.nordgen.org/) is just a big backup of seeds from all over the world, isn’t just for the future generation — current countries are claiming seeds from their land after wars to recoup their losses.

Syria claimed from here in 2015, because of the Syrian Civil War. And ICARDA wanted to regenerated some *allegedly* extinct plants.

Some other ones include:

## Global Oreo Vault

A place in Svalbard that holds all of oreo’s recipes, right down the road from the seed vault.
