Tithonus begged the dawn goddess Eos for immortality, but forgot to ask for eternal youth. Now he’s stuck—old, decaying, and trapped forever beside her glowing, ageless beauty. He envies mortals who get the mercy of death, calls immortality a curse, and pleads with her to undo the gift so he can finally return to the earth and rest.
