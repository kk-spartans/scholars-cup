> The manga series *Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End* portrays a 1000-year old elf with one regret: not getting to know her human companions better before they passed away. This is just one story in a long line of literary works exploring immortality and its consequences. Read the examples below, then discuss with your team: why is immortality such an attractive subject for storytellers? What are some common [implications of immortality](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/immortals-that-show-us-that-death-is-the-best-option/) that they explore?

I think this is attractive because of loneliness, boredom, consumption, and having identity crises (these are also just implications of immortality).
