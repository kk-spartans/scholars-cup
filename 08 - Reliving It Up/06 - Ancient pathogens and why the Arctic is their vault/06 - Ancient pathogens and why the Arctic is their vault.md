> For scientists interested in studying living organisms, they can turn to the UK’s [National Collection of Type Cultures](https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2021/11/10/the-national-collection-of-type-cultures-a-window-to-the-past/), a repository of century-old bacteria samples. Meanwhile, the thawing permafrost in the arctic is exposing [pre-historical pathogens](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/world/permafrost-virus-risk-climate-scn/index.html)—a boon for adventurous virologists but one that raises the concerning possibility of transmission to modern-day humans. Explore with your team: why are so many of these efforts taking place in the arctic?

Permafrost isn’t just cold, it’s dark and oxygen free. So microbes and viruses stay locked up in suspended animations for dozens of thousands years.

But global warming is speeding up thawing, which cracks those open. Now scientists suddenly have access to:

 - Ancient pathogens
 - Preserved specimens
 - Frozen pollutants

But the arctics collection in uncontrolled, and melting in real time — unlike the UK’s NCTC.

The [Global Seed Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault&oldid=1303802826) is also something to mention here, it’s very useful. 

That’s also right next to the [Github Arctic Code Vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o), which has very notable repos like:
