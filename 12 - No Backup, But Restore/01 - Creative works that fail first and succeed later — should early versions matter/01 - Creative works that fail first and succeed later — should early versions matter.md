> Some creative works—including film, theatrical productions, and even novels—fail at the first go, but are then reworked in new ways months, years, or even decades later, in hopes that they can find that missing spark. Consider [the musical Ragtime](https://ew.com/article/2009/11/15/ragtime-2/) as an example of this kind of rebuilding project, then explore the selections below. In which cases did the new version of a project succeed where the first hadn’t? Should the early incarnations of a piece be studied alongside those that succeeded later, or left in the dustbin of history?

```dataview
table author-old, link-old, created-old 
from "12 - No Backup, But Restore/01 - Creative works that fail first and succeed later — should early versions matter"
where file.name != "01 - Creative works that fail first and succeed later — should early versions matter"
```

```dataview
table author-new, link-new, created-new 
from "12 - No Backup, But Restore/01 - Creative works that fail first and succeed later — should early versions matter"
where file.name != "01 - Creative works that fail first and succeed later — should early versions matter"
```

```dataview
table succeded
from "12 - No Backup, But Restore/01 - Creative works that fail first and succeed later — should early versions matter"
where file.name != "01 - Creative works that fail first and succeed later — should early versions matter"
```

I feel all the incarnations of a project should be studied, if they’re more than 50 years old. If they aren’t, there are still people in this world who like those songs — not just because of nostalgia, and that’s a problem for “this is ancient” people.

And nothing, ever, is left in the dustbin of history in this world. Even if we wanted to — look at the [vite vs webpack wars](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1mduzfb/vite_finally_surpassed_webpack/).

Either way, the new ones are mostly better because they adjusted to the new culture better with updated lyrics while still keeping the same tone.
