Humanities problems on earth aren’t philosophical exercises. Climate change, World hunger, and patchy healthcare are immediate, measurable threats that kill millions right now. Fixing them isn’t good PR, it’s basic discipline.

All that said, ignoring space like a billionaire hobby would not turn out well — satellites track storms and crops, worldwide geolocation and emergency SOS, and low probability apocalyptic scenarios (asteroids). This actually justifies a little attention.

SpaceX is the poster child for this tradeoff. Their reusable boosters and launch cadence tech have annihilated cost barriers — hundreds of successful recoveries and dozens of reflights on single boosters show real engineering ROI.

People might say space never makes the earth better — Starlink proves them wrong. Their tech brings internet speeds that even urban areas can’t dream of, to the most remote places in the world. Space exploration can directly solve problems on earth.

But let’s not pretend Earth’s problems are hypothetical. In 2023, over 733 million people faced extreme hunger, (that number has probably increased by now). These aren’t just numbers, they’re lives. Prioritizing space without addressing these issues is like buying a telescope while your house burns down.

So where does that leave us? Aim the investment towards space where it pays back now (climate monitoring, disaster response, internet for rural areas) and regulate the rest so innovation doesn’t cannibalize the working class. Fix the roof first; then use the attic to build a telescope.
