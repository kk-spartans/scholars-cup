Movie starts with some fighting between a brother and a sister, I forget the names. Their mom died and only their grandma is left - and they live in a world where:

> There are 4 benders of elements that people can be, Air, Water, Fire, and Earth - each one can do special things with their element. The 4 benders used to be in harmony, but now are in war.

The girl and the boy are both Waterbenders.

In every single generation, the avatar gets reincarnated. But for the last century, there seemed to be no avatar. Aang, was the avatar 100 years ago and he got frozen, the girl and her brother find him.

After finding him, they find out he has only been thought to become an Airbender. They have to teach him the other 4 elements quick - so they find teachers of them and teach him the elements.

Now they do some weird kidnapping and re-kidnapping Aang before beating the fire nation.

The main part here is how sad Aang was to see his entire family dead and all that when he woke up.
