> “Slice of life” is more than a film genre: research everyday life in the years 1825 and 1925 to learn more about how much things changed between those two years and between 1925 and now. Has the rate of change in your community slowed down or sped up–or does it depend on what you’re looking at?

Considering the research we made In the previous question "Noticing the future through daily details", this should be easy to find out.

I feel like the most helpful source of information here was [Theo's Video About Change Energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBHiis5F2JY)



Considering [[The Routine Right Now]], [[The Routine in the 1920s]], [[The Routine In The 1820s]], [[The Differences Between 1920 and Now]], and [[The Differences Between 1820 and 1920]], we can probably come up with a definitive answer on whether the rate of change has sped up or slowed down.

I feel like that I could rate the change between 1820 and 1920 a 6/10 — because a lot of the changes were mostly quality of life, not actually changing people's routines.

The rate of change between 1920 and now is much more, something like a 9/10 — because not only did our routines change, but the jobs we have and the things we learn did too.

Does it depend on what you're looking at? No. It does not, most fields are affected by this; the economy changed, how people talk to each other changed - **everything changed.**
