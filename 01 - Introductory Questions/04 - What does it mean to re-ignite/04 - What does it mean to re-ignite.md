> Some things catch fire literally, others metaphorically—and the fires that most interest us are those happening for at least the second time. Without reading the rest of this outline, brainstorm with your friends what it could mean for something to *re*-ignite, and how different that is than igniting in the first place. When is it better for something to burn twice? And is there a difference between burning *up*, burning *down*, and burning *with*?

## Re-Igniting

Re-igniting — something or someone coming back to life with a new instead of the one that failed before. Maybe even bringing bringing back the one that failed before (like [[Burbn]] became Instagram). A really good example would be [[X (aka Twitter)]].

You don't have to be successful the second time you ignite; for example, [[Juicero]] (which tried more than 2 times.)

This is different from igniting in the first place, which is when these companies (and others) first started. This doesn't have to be just for companies, it can be ideas that **you** create or relationships that **you** have with other people.

It's better for something to burn twice when that burn is controlled, Instagram got lucky because meta bought them. Otherwise, they had no way of making money with 30 million users already. But X had a very controlled 2nd burn.

## Burning Up, Down, And With

 - **Burning Up** - Something burning without control, and demolishing everything in it's way. For example, [[Theranos]]
 - **Burning Down** - Something that burns in a controlled way but still fails. For example [[Myspace]]
 - **Burning With** - Something that burns in a controlled way and stays alive for a long time. For example, [[Signal]]
