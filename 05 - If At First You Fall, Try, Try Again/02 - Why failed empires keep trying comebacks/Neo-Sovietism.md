- **Trying to be:** The USSR’s global influence, centralized control, and great-power status.
- **How close?** Post-Soviet Russia has tried to reassert regional dominance and Soviet-style nostalgia domestically, but without the economic bloc or ideological spread. More cosplay than full reboot.
- **Longevity:** Still ongoing, but nowhere near the USSR’s scale—unlikely to last as long (USSR = 69 *nice* years).
