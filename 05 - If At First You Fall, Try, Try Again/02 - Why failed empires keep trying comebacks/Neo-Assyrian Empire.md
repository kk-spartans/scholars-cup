- **Trying to be:** The earlier Assyrian kingdoms that had been around since the 25th century BCE.
- **Vibe:** Brutal military expansion, massive architecture, and bureaucratic control over a huge multi-ethnic empire.

- **Longevity:** Longer than any earlier Assyrian state. They peaked, but the fall was permanent.
