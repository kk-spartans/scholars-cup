- **Trying to be:** A return to direct imperial rule in Japan, evoking ancient Yamato sovereignty—plus heavy borrowing from Western powers for modernization.
- **How close?** Extremely successful: turned Japan from a feudal state into an industrial power that could beat China and Russia in war.
- **Longevity:** The emperor system lasted until WWII’s defeat in 1945 (77 years of real political power) and nominally continues today. Outlived the shogunate but not Japan’s ancient imperial *line*.
