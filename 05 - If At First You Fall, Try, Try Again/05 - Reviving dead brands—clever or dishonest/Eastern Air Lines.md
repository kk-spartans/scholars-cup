Founded in 1926, it was a major U.S. airline until its collapse in 1991 due to financial troubles and labor disputes.

In 2011, a new company acquired the brand's intellectual property and began operating charter flights under the Eastern name.

The airline primarily serves routes between the U.S. and Latin America, maintaining the nostalgic branding of the original carrier.
