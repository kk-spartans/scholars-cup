> Destroyed buildings can also have second leases on life. Consider the following examples, then discuss with your team: is a reconstruction of a building a continuation or something altogether new?

```dataview
table continuation-or-new
from "05 - If At First You Fall, Try, Try Again/03 - Is rebuilding a ruin preservation or reinvention"
where file.name != "03 - Is rebuilding a ruin preservation or reinvention"
```
