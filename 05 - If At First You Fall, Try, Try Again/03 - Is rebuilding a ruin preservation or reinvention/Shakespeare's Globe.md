The original Globe (1599) burned in 1613 and was demolished in the 17th century; it survived only in records and archaeology.

From the 1970s a long-running campaign led by Sam Wanamaker reconstructed a faithful, working replica on Bankside using timber framing, period stagecraft, and historical design principles; the modern Globe (opened 1997) deliberately recreates an Elizabethan playhouse experience rather than claiming unbroken material continuity.
