Revival of the *legendary* library of Alexandrina. It was founded in 300 BCE under by the kings of Egypt. Meant to be the *endgame* repo of all texts - Greece, Mesopotamia, India, etc.

The new bibliotheca was opened in 2002 beside the supposed location of the ancient one. It’s not just a library — it’s also a research institution, museum complex, planetarium, and cultural hub.
