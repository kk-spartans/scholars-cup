The Ryukyu royal palace complex dates back to the medieval Ryukyu Kingdom (roughly 14th century onward) and served as a political and cultural center; it burned repeatedly over the centuries and was destroyed in World War II.

A postwar reconstruction (1958â€“1992) revived the castle as a symbol of Okinawan identity and tourism; after another devastating fire in October 2019, rebuilding efforts began again using traditional design vocabulary but modern materials and building codes.
