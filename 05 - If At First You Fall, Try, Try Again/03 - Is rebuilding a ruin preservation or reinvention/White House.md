In 1814, during the War of 1812 (what?), British troops set fire to the White House, burning much of the interior and charring the exterior. Congress had already fled, so it was mostly symbolic â€” but the building was left basically gutted.

It was rebuilt and restored over the next few years. James Monroe moved in in 1817, and over time it got expansions and renovations.
