> Could 3.5 inch floppy discs be next? (They do make good coasters.) From [audio cassettes](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/20/fun-way-consume-music-why-sales-of-cassette-tapes-soaring) to [instant cameras](https://web.archive.org/web/20250117102550/https://studybreaks.com/thoughts/polaroid-instant-film/), many vintage technologies are enjoying a resurgence today, often driven by viral online trends that [celebrate their limitations](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64512059). Discuss with your team: why do some products and brands become popular again after gathering dust for so long? When do you prefer something older and (technically) worse to something newer and (technically) better?

Some (like disposable cameras, vinyl, and film) are just because of nostalgia. But others, they aren’t ‘(technically) worse’ — they’re better.

Pagers, Shortwave radios, and AM radios have actual utility in this world — mostly in emergencies or for hobbyists.

And for magnetic tape, it’s just better, period (for the price). It’s the cheapest medium of storage — ever.
