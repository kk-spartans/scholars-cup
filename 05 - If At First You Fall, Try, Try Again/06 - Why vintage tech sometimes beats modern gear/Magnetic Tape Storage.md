I **will** defend myself.

Some places don’t need nvme ssds as fast as vram from the 2010s, they just need cheap storage. And magnetic tape is cheaper than dirt while being a bit faster than HDDs (but need more gear, which doesn’t matter at mass).

|                   | Magnetic Tape | NVMe SSDs | HDDs |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------- | ---- |
| Price/TB          | $11~          | $60~      | $13~ |
| Read/Write (MB/s) |               |           |      |
|                   |               |           |      |
