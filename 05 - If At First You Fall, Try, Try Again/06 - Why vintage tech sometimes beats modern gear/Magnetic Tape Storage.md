I **will** defend myself.

Some places donâ€™t need nvme ssds as fast as vram from the 2010s, they just need cheap storage. And magnetic tape is cheaper than dirt.


|                   | Magnetic Tape | NVMe SSDs | HDDs |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------- | ---- |
| Price/TB          |               |           |      |
| Read/Write (MB/s) |               |           |      |
