> Rasputin may be the most famous Russian monk, but he wasn’t the first to opine on geopolitical affairs. In the 16th century, his distant (and also lushly-bearded) predecessor Filofei proposed (in letters to a young prince named Vassilij) that Russia could be the third Rome. Consider what he meant then and what the implications of his suggestion might be today, then discuss with your team: could there be another Rome in our own era, and would it be good for the world if there were? Would Greenland be part of it?

```

To be clear, Filofei’s “Third Rome” idea was basically:

- First Rome - the Roman Empire, center of Christianity until it fell.
 
- Second Rome - Constantinople (Byzantine Empire), which claimed Rome’s mantle until the Ottomans took it in 1453.

- Third Rome - Moscow, which he thought should inherit that role as the new spiritual and political leader of Christendom.

In 1500s political-speak, this was less about “world domination” and more about moral and spiritual leadership—though, fr, it also set up an *unusually convenient* justification for Russian imperial expansion.

If someone revived the “Third rome” concept now, it’d basically be a PR stunt for political power. It would probably push towards being a multipolar challenge to the U.S.-led order imo.

## Could There Be Another Rome Today?

Realistically, any modern “Rome” would be less about controlling territory and more about controlling narrative, tech, culture, and influence — mostly soft power.

## Would Greenland Be Part Of It?

Only if climate change keeps melting ice caps. Suddenly Greenland’s sitting on valuable shipping lanes and rare minerals. Then any “new Rome” would absolutely want it.
