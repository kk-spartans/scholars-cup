Soft power — something you can’t get with just money, something like fame and respect. Something like owning the only currency the world uses for international trade (USD) and being the country that everyone assumes is the ‘best’.

Hard power is something that anyone can get with enough money and resources, like military. Something like owning enough nuclear bombs to pulverize a planet from existence.
