To be clear, when something is ai generated - it's **explicitly** mentioned (other than the short titles in the home of each theme). And, when I generate something with AI, I’m either:

 - Confident that I **completely** agree with it
 - Hope my teammates will do a better job than me at that topic because I *give up* (especially in Social Studies and Art and Literature).

Anything above the “(gpt4o/5/whatever model generated)” — **I wrote**. And if there’s a hr (`---`) below it, the AI part ends.

If I learnt one lesson from this, it’s that I shouldn’t have started listening to the Spotify playlist before starting this research — because everything from there shows up in the guiding questions eventually.
