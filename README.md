To be clear, when something is ai generated - it's **explicitly** mentioned (other than the short titles in the home of each theme). And, when I generate something with AI, I’m either:

 - Confident that I **completely** agree with it
 - Hope my teammates will do a better job than me at that topic because I *give up* (especially in Social Studies and Art and Literature).

Anything above the “(gpt4o/5/whatever model generated)” — **I wrote**. And if there’s a hr (`---`) below it, the AI part ends.

Just because something isn’t labelled AI doesn’t mean the entire thing is completely written by me — that’s never true, for anything.

All links to wikipedia are permanent links, because I don’t want info that wasn’t as it was when I looked at it changing — so some of them might be outdated.
