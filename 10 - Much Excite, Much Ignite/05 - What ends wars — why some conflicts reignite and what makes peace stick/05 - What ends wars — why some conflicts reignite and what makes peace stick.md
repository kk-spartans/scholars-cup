> Like dormant volcanoes, not every war can be suppressed forever. Treaties break; truces fail to hold. Explore why some periods of conflict lasted as long as they did, then discuss with your team: what does it take to “put out” a war so that it doesn’t reignite? To what extent were there periods of quiet within the larger scope of the violence around them? Is the best way to achieve a lasting peace for one side to win a conflict decisively?

Why these dragged on forever:

## Periods Of Quite

Most long wars weren’t constant slaughter. Armistices, winter, famine, or political wrangling often meant years of relative peace, even if tensions were simmering. Hundred Years War is basically a patchwork of fighting bursts and calm decades.

## Putting Out A War For Good

Total victory can work, but it often breeds resentment. Look at Punic Wars — Carthage destroyed, Rome safe... but in other cases, a decisive win probably means future rebellion.

Treaties that address root causes, economic stability, power sharing, or mutual respect usually do better at lasting peace. Not cool, but more effective.

The best way to achieve peace is definitely not for one side to decisively win a conflict.
