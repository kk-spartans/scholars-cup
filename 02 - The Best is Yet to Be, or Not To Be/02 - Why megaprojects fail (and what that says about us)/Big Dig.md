## What happened before 
The Big Dig was a megaproject in Boston that rerouted the elevated Central Artery of Interstate 93 into the O'Neill Tunnel and built the Ted Williams Tunnel to extend Interstate 90 to Logan International Airport. ((wikepedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Dig&oldid=1297231972]). 

This had been a problem since the 1930s, although it was slightly mitigated by the fact that in the 1950s, Governor John Volpe interceded to change the design of the last section of the Central Artery, putting it underground through the Dewey Square Tunnel.

## What happened during
So, In the 1980s somone said "What if we buried it?" and the US Goverment: *gives blank check*. It started in 1991, was supposed to be done by 1998 (~$3b). It was actually(-ish) done in 2007, with a cost of around $15b (closer to $24b with inflation and interest). 

Even after that, they still had delays, changes, leaks, the accidental death of multiple people. Just a normal day in the US. They still built  a tunnel, extended I90, and built the Zakim Bridge.

## What happened after
Traffic still exists, the Rose Kennedy Greenway replaced the ugly highway, technically finished but maintanance is burns cash, and *still* widely mocked.
