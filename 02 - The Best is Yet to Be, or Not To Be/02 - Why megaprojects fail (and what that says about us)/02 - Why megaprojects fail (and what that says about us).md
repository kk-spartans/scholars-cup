> Don’t worry, Australia—you’re not alone. (More on loneliness later.) In Canada, a proposed high-speed rail network had its target speed slashed before being rebranded as a [high *frequency*](https://thewalrus.ca/high-speed-rail/) network. In many developed countries, ambitious projects have [gone out of fashion](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bertha-seattle-infrastructure-trouble-megaprojects) in favor of slow, incremental ones. Check out the mega projects below, as well as those from your own country, then discuss with your team: is this shift in approach justified? How might megaprojects (or their failure) affect the way people [perceive progress?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02513625.2019.1630189#d1e235) And are some countries more consistently successful at these projects?
