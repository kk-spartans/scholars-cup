## What Happened before

Saudi Arabia, facing the inevitable decline of oil, decided to reinvent itself. Crown Prince MBS launched “Vision 2030,” a plan to modernize the country. The crown jewel? (NEOM)[neom.com] — a $500B futuristic mega-city in the desert that would run on AI, green energy, and extreme ambition.

The name "NEOM" is derived from two words. The first three letters from the Ancient Greek prefix neo-meaning "new". The fourth letter is from the abbreviation of Mostaqbal, an arabic word meaning "future". (UN Tourism)[https://www.unwto.org/affiliate-member-organization/526883]

## What Happened during

Announced in 2017, NEOM promised flying cars, robot maids, a moon simulation, and “The Line” — a 170km linear city with no roads. Construction started, and the human rights violations followed. Indigenous tribes were evicted, workers died, and actual progress lagged far behind flashy CGI renders. The budget keeps growing, but so do the delays.

## What Happened after

As of 2025, parts of NEOM are technically under construction. Drones fly around and show some real buildings, but it’s still far from livable. Critics say it’s an overpriced PR stunt. Supporters say it’s the future. Unlike the Khazar Islands, this might eventually finish (The line is supposed to finish in 100 years — never.)
