> In 2009, the Australian government announced an ambitious project to provide super-fast fiber-based Internet to 93% of the population; in 2013, it revised the plan to reuse existing copper wire; in 2025, many Australians [still have no (or slow) Internet](https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/23/australian_national_broadband_network_complete/). First promise big things, then revise the promise to make them little things, then don’t finish them anyway. This isn’t (we hope) a description of the World Scholar’s Cup curriculum release process, but a pattern of behavior for governments all over the world. Discuss with your team: is it better to underpromise and overdeliver, or vice versa?

 - First, let's cover [[Australia's NBN]]
 - Now, look at some projects that underpromised and overdelivered: [[Estonia's E-Goverment]], and [[The Nintendo Wii]]

So which was better?

<summary>Guess. Don't open this until guessing.</summary>

Underpromising and overdelivering is obviously better — Look, if Australia failed (and they did), the public would (and does) hate them. But if the wii or e-goverment failed, they could just say "waste of money" and have no PR damage. If they succeeded, it's positive PR and more money for them.

I'm ignoring the fact that all press is good press.
