Bluesky ([bsky](bsky.app)) is a decentralized social media platform, basically Bitcoin for tweets (sorry, X posts).

Think of it like email, if I use Gmail and you use Outlook, we can send emails to each other — and we may use these two because they have their own features that we like.

Bluesky is trying to do that for social media platforms, if I use Instagram and you use Facebook, we should still be able to talk.

What it’s doing that’s actually different (the “feature” that kept you from switching) is custom feeds, you can choose a feed that you want to view art in and another feed that you want to view technology in.
