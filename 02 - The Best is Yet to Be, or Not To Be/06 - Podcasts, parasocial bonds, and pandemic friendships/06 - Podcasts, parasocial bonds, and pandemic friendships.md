> During the Covid pandemic, podcasts exploded in popularity. Their hosts (or at least their subtly-enhanced voices) became [many people’s closest friends](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/07/tragic-but-true-have-podcasters-replaced-our-real-friends) in a solitary time. Discuss with your team: are podcasts meaningfully different from old-fashioned radio broadcasts in their impact on society, and will their impact continue? In other words, how dated will this bullet seem, ten years from now?)

In my opinion, podcasts are split it into two categories:

 - Stuff that’s for pure entertainment or teaches you things about a very specific person / topic that has no use irl other than engaging in more gossip (Ex: The Talk Tuah Podcast)
 - Things that teach you real things about a broad or niche topic that’s actually useful in real life, whether it’s making purchase decisions or just getting information.

The podcasts that are growing in popularity right now is the first type, because no one wants to listen to a person talk about a single topic for hours on end (other than me, I guess).

This is definitely different from radio broadcasts, in the sense that this lets the person listen to it at any time. The hosts can also do many things that they couldn’t do on radio, like swear or share info about themselves that’s very revealing (bad choice of words, I know). Mostly, just be more casual.

Will this be there in 10 years? Let the trend graphs decide that, I used whatever medium was relevant to each trend (youtube and google search):

As you can see, [[Blogging]] decreased in popularity after it’s hype ended - and I predict the same will happen to podcasting too. It won’t completely disappear, just like blogs haven’t completely disappeared.
