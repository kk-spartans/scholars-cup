> Some people claim not to believe anything politicians say. For them, political speeches are works of fiction. But fictional politicians also give speeches—some of them very effectively. Consider the example below, then discuss with your team: what made them effective, and would they have worked equally well in the real world?

```dataview
table movie-or-show, year
from "07 - Speeches that Inspire, Speeches that Spit Fire/02 - Fictional speeches that feel real — why they work"
where file.name != "02 - Fictional speeches that feel real — why they work"
