(*cough* WW2 was only 3 years later lol *cough*)

Speech mostly covers how Ethiopia got invaded by Italy and whines to the UN (formerly League of Nations) about how they should’ve protected small nations more. And how if they don’t stop this now, it’s going to be worse in the future.

This is speech is also, not naive. But I don’t think it’s supposed to be inspirational in the first place
